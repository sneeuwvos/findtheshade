Find the Shade

This library is about picking the right shade of make up. It
is a common problem that people end up with the shade of
make up they are not happy with, and feel challenged by the
task of finding the right shade for them.

This library addresses the case when someone has their photo
where their skin color vs wrong shade is visible, and they
know the name of this shade. What the library aims to do is
to recommend them better make-up shades.

It is the base C library. An UI on the top of it should be a
separate project.
